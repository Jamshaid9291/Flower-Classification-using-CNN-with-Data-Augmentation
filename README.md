# Flower-Classification-using-CNN-with-Data-Augmentation
This project demonstrates how to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch (or TensorFlow/Keras, if you're using that) to classify images of flowers into multiple categories. In addition to building a baseline model, we explore the problem of overfitting and apply data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
